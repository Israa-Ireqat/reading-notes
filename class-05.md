# **Text**
* Serif : 
Serif fonts have extra details on
the ends of the main strokes of
the letters. These details are
known as serifs.
* Sans-Serif: 
Sans-serif fonts have straight
ends to letters, and therefore
have a much cleaner design.
* Monospace : 
Every letter in a monospace (or
fixed-width) font is the same
width.
* Cursive : 
Cursive fonts either have
joining strokes or other cursive
characteristics, such as
handwriting styles.
* Fantasy : 
Fantasy fonts are usually
decorative fonts and are often
used for titles. They're not
designed for long bodies of text.
