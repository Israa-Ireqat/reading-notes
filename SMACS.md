## Responsive vs. Adaptive vs. Mobile
Responsive and adaptive web design are closely related, 
* Responsive: to react quickly and positively to any change.
* adaptive: to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation.
* A combination of the two is ideal, providing the perfect formula for functional websites.
* Mobile: to build a separate website commonly on a new domain solely for mobile users.
